# Level Effect Cyber Defense CTF Writeups

The Level Effect Cyber Defense CTF was so much fun and I learned a ton! I love a long CTF that allows
you to really dig in and figure stuff out. I'm really pleased with how I did on this one and wanted to
commit some of my notes as writeups for my own reference.

There were more than 100 challenges in the following categories:
* OSINT
* Forensics
* Networking
* Crypto
* Email/Phishing
* Incident Response
* Log Analysis
* Scripting
* Reverse Engineering

I took notes of some sort on most of the ones I did, but I'm only going to write up a few, and I'm
actually going to start with one I didn't finish because I thought it was so cool.

Completed:
* Networking: Drip Drop
